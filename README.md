# FoxEDPad
##Introduction
While playing Elite Dangerous i always had the problem of not having enough Buttons on my Joystick. So i wrote this small programm.
Launch the app on your Android phone and send keystokes to the client like with your keyboard. 
##Installation
* Download and extract everything in a folder of your choice
* Install FoxEDPad.apk from the FoxEDPad-folder on your Android device
* In the app go to Precerences and configure it with the IP-address of your local PC
* Go to FoxEdTabServer-folder and open keys.config
* Change the key you want to press. You can choose letters from a - z. Make sure you have the same keys configured in Elite Dangerous
##Start 
*Open FoxEdTabServer.exe and your App on your Android device
* Play the game and have fun

##To come
Perhaps i will add more functionality later on. Atm im quite happy with it.
